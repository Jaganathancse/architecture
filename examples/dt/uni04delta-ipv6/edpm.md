# Deploying the OpenStack dataplane

## Assumptions

- The [control plane](control-plane.md) has been successfully deployed.
- The [ceph](edpm-pre-ceph.md) has been successfully deployed and ceph has been installed.

## Initialize

Switch to the "openstack" namespace

```bash
oc project openstack
```

Change to the delta's edpm directory

```bash
cd architecture/examples/dt/uni04delta-ipv6
```

Modify the [values.yaml](values.yaml) with the following information

- SSH keys to be used for accessing the deployed compute nodes.
- SSH keys to be use for Nova migration.
- Ceph Configuration information

> The SSH key values must be in base64 encoded format.

The ceph sections of [values.yaml](values.yaml) should have values
like this.
```yaml
data:
    ceph:
        conf: $CONF
        keyring: $KEY
    nova:
      ceph:
        conf:
            conf: |
              [libvirt]
              images_type=rbd
              images_rbd_pool=vms
              images_rbd_ceph_conf=/etc/ceph/ceph.conf
              images_rbd_glance_store_name=default_backend
              images_rbd_glance_copy_poll_interval=15
              images_rbd_glance_copy_timeout=600
              rbd_user=openstack
              rbd_secret_uuid=$FSID

```
Where the values of the three variables above can be retrieved by
running the following commands on the Ceph cluster.
```shell
CONF=$(cat /etc/ceph/ceph.conf | base64 -w 0)
KEY=$(cat /etc/ceph/ceph.client.openstack.keyring | base64 -w 0)
FSID=$(awk -F ' = ' '/fsid/ {print $2}' /etc/ceph/ceph.conf)
```

### Compute access

1. Set `data['authorized']` with the value of all OpenStack Compute host SSH
  keys.
2. Set `data['private']` with the contents of the SSH private key to be used
  for accessing the dataplane compute nodes.
3. Set `data['public']` with the contents of the SSH public key used for
  accessing the dataplane compute nodes.

### Nova migration

1. Set `data['nova']['migration']['ssh_keys']['private']` with the content of
  the SSH private key to be used for potential future migration.
2. Set `data['nova']['migration']['ssh_keys']['public']` with the content of
  the SSH public key to be used for potential future migration.

## CRs nodeset

Generate the nodeset CRs.

```bash
kustomize build > edpm-nodeset.yaml
```

## Create CRs nodeset

```bash
oc apply -f edpm-nodeset.yaml
```

Wait for nodeset deployment to finish

```bash
oc wait osdpns openstack-edpm --for condition=SetupReady --timeout=1200s
```

## CRs deployment

Change to the deployment folder

```bash
cd deployment
```
Generate the deployment CRs.

```bash
kustomize build > edpm.yaml
```

## Create CRs deployment

```bash
oc apply -f edpm.yaml
```

Wait for deployment to finish

```bash
oc wait osdpd edpm-deployment --for condition=Ready --timeout=2400s
```
